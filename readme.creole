== Hacker News: Mark All Read

This is the source code for the Chrome extension [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogfbcfkihdkplelnaenpgkhnkpoaggjc|Hacker News: Mark All Read]]

=== Saving Time on Hacker News

I created this extension out of my own frustration: I was bored at having to always scan the whole list of news on the HN home page to find
which one were actually new. I got a lot from the community, so I decided to take the time to polish the project a little and share it with
everybody else who will find it useful. Enjoy!

=== More Features

Version 1.3 adds many new features that are described here: [[http://danmaz74.me/portfolio/hacker-news-mark-all-read/|Blog announcement]]

=== Open Source

I find most convenient to have this as a Chrome extension, but if you want to repack it for any other browser
you're free to do so. Just, please, create your own artwork for the button and icons if you want to publish an extension of your own.

If you find any bugs, or improve the core functionality, you're very welcome to send me a pull request.
